"Can anyone advise me on how to log this multicache? Not sure what the proper geocaching etiquette is. I sort of found my first 2 part multi today. Found the 1st container easily. I had to assemble a jigsaw puzzle (if anyone had told me that, at 39 years old, I'd take up a hobby that required me to sit in the woods and assemble an Avengers puzzle...) to get the 2nd coordinates written on the back. Went to the 2nd site, and only found a camo tape-covered rubbermaid lid. Obviously a geocache container lid. The rest had apparently been muggled. I reported what I had found, but not sure now if it was proper to log it as a find? Should (can) I change it to a dnf?

TL;DR: Found remnants of an apparently muggled cache at end of a multi. Find or DNF?

Edit: 
The owner sent me a message and said that I had found part of one (of several) that he had lost due to flooding. It's been replaced with a different container off the ground. He kindly offered to count it as a find, but I think I want to go back out find the correct one just for the satisfaction of completing it.",Not sure how to log cache,geocaching

"I think making finds and solving puzzles are the most rewarding and satisfying when you have the minimum amount of help needed to actually be successful. Some people will need lots of help, others will need none.

Along those lines, there are several times I've thought of providing multiple levels of hints for my hides. Starting with maybe some very subtle gentle nudges (eg - ""Ignore the rocks"" or ""Years are important"") to point the user in the right direction, and eventually working up to full spoilers - ""Here's what you have to do..."".

For this to work well, though, I think you'd need to be able to only reveal one hint at a time. And I'm not sure of a good way to do that since the GC.com Hint field is all-or-nothing.

Have any of you ever done something similar?","Any good way to have multiple incremental hints (from gentle nudge, to full on spoiler) in a listing?",geocaching

"1. ""It's faster and easier to go cross country instead of the trail""  It would have been except for the steep hills, ankle high poky stuff, rocks and dead trees everywhere, I went to go find one today and I decided to go cross country and leave the trail because it didn't appear to be going the right direction, it took 40 minutes to get to the cache. I decide to follow the trail back, and it was less than 10 minutes to get to the spot where I left the trail.  :/  -_-

2. ""It's not even 1/2 of a mile in, this will only take 20 minutes!"" Yes, it's less than a half mile, but that only by direction. It's actually closer to 2 hours with all those switchbacks (bah) and bushwhacking up a steep hill.

3. ""Maybe these picnickers will leave soon so I can get that nano""  Nope, try again later, you've just encountered your local chapter of The Loyal Loiterers Club where they required to stay in the same spot and study the pull of gravity on sedentary objects in that 20ft area for the next 3 hours.

4. ""Uh, hmmm, nah.... they can't see me poking around the bricks from there."" They can, they are herding their small children as far away from you as possible, and possibly called the police. I been asked while leaving a trail if I saw anyone strange ""acting jumpy, falling over rocks and talking under their breath"". It was an embarrassingly long time before I realized that that was probably me.

5. ""If I ever find a ammo can full of cash while doing this, I'll do the right thing and turn it over to the police.""  After I'm done doing a jig like a happy miner, I'll begrudgingly call the police. However, the mason jar of silver dollars (or steel pennies) is aaaalllll miiiinnneee.

"TLDR: Went on walk, geo-eye spotted something. I believe it's a cache, signed log with no other names, but no cache on the website.

While walking today I saw what I believe to be a geocache, I just saw something odd out of the corner of my eye, investigated, and found a tubberware box with a few small trinkets, a sheet of paper labelled ""log book"". My phone was dead at the time but I wasn't aware of any cache in the area, and I've gone home and confirmed no other caches appear on the website, I'm not a premium member and there are some local puzzle cache I have not solved, but these should surely have other cachers names in?

There was no GC code written on the log, and no this is a geocaching game peice, please leave it be card which sometimes appear, but I'm reasonably confident that it must be a cache (or some sort of similar game?)

Basically, do people think it's fair if I claim this as FTF? I know some people take these very seriously but I've never been that bothered. I don't know who hid the cache, and received no other information about it, it was hidden reasonably obvious, with a bright blue lid facing out of the hole. Ultimately I did sign the log (and wrote a brief message) and turned the cache around to make it marginally less obvious. If the cache has been recently placed then I also have longer term concerns, the contense where already slightly dam and there hasn't been and local rainfall.

So what should I do? And is it fair if I claim this as a find/FTF? Ultimately I feel I didn't have any additional information or advantage, but equally some local cachers are going to get the alert should it be published and head out disappointed, as I won't receive the alerts (but surely thats how it was before smartphones). The cache isn't very far from where I live so if people think I'm playing unfair I was considering going back and changing the logbook for one of my own, at this point I have no idea who CO is as their name dosn't appear in the cache and I can't find a web-listing. Equally, if the cache turns out to be a puzzle/multi final then I haven't solved and complected the cache as intended.

Just curious what other people would do in this situation and if they think ultimately this was a fare move. This isn't the first time I have found a cache without knowing one was there, but in previous cases it wasn't a FTF and they where traditional caches, so I felt I was still perfectly justified in logging them, but for some reason the fact it would be a FTF makes me feel more apprehensive, even though they are ultimately meaningless.",Claiming FTF before cache published,geocaching

"Until today, I was thinking that the ""field puzzle"" attribute was reserved for physical puzzles that you find at some stage of a cache. Whether it's something mechanical, a jigsaw puzzle, or just a laminated crossword puzzle... ""field puzzle"", to me, meant that when you're at those coords, you will find the physical puzzle there.

But today, I published a Mystery cache where the first stage is a virtual and leads you to a sign. The cache listing page has a puzzle that you use the sign to solve, which then leads you to the final. I did not put the ""field attribute"" because there's no physical puzzle anywhere. The puzzle is only on the listing page. My reviewer also made no mention of adding it.

Then I was almost immediately contacted by another geocacher saying that they were trying to solve it remotely, but couldn't read the sign in Google Street View, so I should probably set the ""field puzzle"" attribute.

So, now I'm second guessing my notion of ""field puzzle"". Does it just mean that you can't discover the final coords while sitting at your desk? Something else?

"So, I've been brainstorming ideas for field puzzle caches that I can create out of an ammo can. It's a little tricky because I need the ammo can to keep everything dry, so there needs to be some other separate lock/container insde the ammo can to be the goal of the field puzzle.

Then, it occurred to me... what if I only lock up the log (requiring puzzle solving to unlock), but just leave the swag loose in the ammo can? That felt like it could simplify things a lot because I could just take a logbook, drill a hole in it, and attach a padlock. Then it can't be opened or signed without solving the puzzle. But then, I guess you could take/trade swag without solving the puzzle.

So, the ammo can would contain: swag, a puzzle, and a locked logbook.

"The geocaching rules say that the logbook must be: physical, replaceable, easy to sign and enclosed within a container.

So does this mean there is no possibility to have an electronic logbook? 

For example, let's say you need a 9V battery/USB power bank to open the cache. When you put the 9V battery/USB power bank in place, the cache would open and reveal a small screen and a keyboard. Then you could type in your name and it would list all the other names on the screen. Would this kind of 'logbook' be against the rules? I would say it is pretty easy to sign, it is kind of physical, because it is there, not on the internet or something and it is enclosed in the container..

I have doubts this would be accepted. I just wonder why the logbook always has to be a piece of paper that gets wet and moldy over time. ",Rules about the logbook,geocaching

I'm getting interested into doing some geocaching recently. I have not done any outside of city yet. But I feel like having a handheld GPS might help when I get to do some where I have no service for my iPhone.

I'm concerned about a 4 year old technology tho, should I be looking more for the Montana / Oregon series ?

"Little backstory: when I first got a GPS like 11-12 years ago and found out this existed, I wanted to give it go. There was supposed to be a cache in a park not far from me. I never found it and gave up, but always wanted to try again. A few days ago, my wife and I were talking about a grave in a cemetery around the corner (oldest in the state) and when googling it, a source for geocaching came up, and when I mentioned it, she said how she was interested but never tried, so hell, now we have a new hobby. I watched the beginner videos and all that. I do EDC too, and noticed there's a lot of crossover in gear. 

So we went out twice this week to the cache at that grave and couldn't find it, and then tried another nearby. But going by the logs, that could be missing. Today we did errands, and one of the stores had a puzzle cache. I solved it last night, and went searching today. She opted to stay in the car cuz there were bees around, but I was determined after 2 DNFs, stings be damned.

But I found it pretty quickly, it was a micro at the end of a fake, rubber rat. I grabbed the tail and in a bit of excitement, yelled ""got it!"" and ran over to the car to show her...apparently looking a little crazy like I was holding a real dead rat. I took my time signing to make sure the people who saw me left so they didn't watch me put it back or anything.

After the errands, we went to her grandmother's, and there was a P&amp;G close by, near a monument. Only, it was supposed to be a in tree and my wife found it on the ground. I put it back closer to the trunk so it didn't get ""muggled"" and logged that it fell, and the owner should maybe come take a peek at it (just had some nasty storms all week, and the log was also soggy). Was that the appropriate thing to do? I tried to learn all the etiquette and everything, but obviously still new.

Already planning the next ones to look for when I have other stops to make next week and maybe a day trip with the missus next weekend. That cache in the park from 2005 is still active, so I need to go find my white whale :)","Found my 1st (and 2nd) cache today, just wanted to share",geocaching

"I finally convinced my 11 year old son to try geocaching. So, we got the app, created an account and went to the nearest two that seemed to be rated easy to do. We failed at both. The first seemed to be directing us into somebody's fenced backyard, so I wondered if it meant a couple of large pine trees that were still in someone's front yard, so I didn't want to be digging around in the dirt, especially in someone's yard.

The second one we ended up on a wooden walking bridge over a creek. The spot was around the middle of the bridge. We checked all around the handrails and didn't find anything. Then, I noticed that the reeds in the water were pushed down in one spot as though someone had jumped down off the bridge (it was only a foot above the water that was only a few inches deep). Still, I wasn't prepared for us to be going into mud and water or jumping off bridges (even short ones)...

Maybe they were just really small? The first one said it was intended to be easy for little kids, but we didn't see anything.

Both said they were found earlier this month, so I'm not sure what we were doing wrong, but this was our first try so I admit I don't know what to expect; I saw in the videos linked from here that some are difficult to find, but I thought since these were rated ""easy""...",How dirty do you have to be willing to get?,geocaching

"Recently I got my hands on nearly all of the episodes of the Geotalk podcast by Darren Osborne, aka Spindoc Bob:

The podcast for geocachers 'down under'. It contains news about geocaching in Australia and New Zealand, interviews with Australian and New Zealand geocachers, tips on finding geocaches, and competitions.

Darren was the first president of GeocachingNSW, an advocacy group for geocaching in New South Wales, Australia. Thanks to him there is an protocol with National Parks and Wildlife Services with regards to the placement of caches in National Parks in NSW. He passed away in January 2015 after a short battle with brain cancer. These podcasts are part of the legacy he left for the geocaching community.

"I just posted a DNF on a cache I've looked for 4 times now. It was last found on May 4th. However, before that one (and the log said it was on the ground when they found it) it was found in November last year with a string of DNFs. 

The hint is 'magnetic' and the coords took me to the center of a ring of metal fence posts. No cache on any of them.

"So, we are considering placing our first cache.

I would like to have a larger container to give people a chance to trade things. What containers would be the best for this idea? Thinking about making one myself, but except for a bird house, I have no idea where to start.

The location would be at 500m from my house, so pretty easy to check and perform maintenance.

"I have known about geocaching for a long time, and had always meant to give it a go, but or some reason I only got around to it today.

My eight year old daughter was bored, and I was trying to think of something to do with her, so I downloaded a geocaching app to see what all the fuss was about.

I found a cache within walking distance.
We like to go for walks together and explore the neighborhood, so I knew she would like the added element of hunting for a cache.

I asked if she wanted to go on a 'treasure hunt', and tried to explain what the idea was.

 Was pretty surprised when she said 'Daddy, are you talking about geocaching?'

Turns out some of her favorite youtubers do it, so she already knew all about it lol.

Anyway, we had a nice 0.7 (each way) mile walk which turned out to be about a 5 mile hike because there were a load of dead ends around a private wooded area.

We did not find the cache itself.
Some of the recent comments said it might be missing, and examining the area, I found exactly where it was supposed to be stuck with magnets.

The object that it was supposed to be stuck to was great though - it was a large wooden bird house full of books, with a sign saying: 

'Want a book? Take a book. Have a book? Leave a book!'

We did not know about this, so we didn't have a book, so we took a book and left a transparent purple die we had brought along.

We'll go back (by car next time!) and leave a couple of books.

Apart from an unexpectedly long walk and a couple of blisters, we had a great time and will definitely do it again.

"Backstory: I started back in 2002 pretty heavy. Had a big slump for a bunch of years, and now am getting back into this. Bought a new GPS and have found more caches this month than I have in the previous decade. Overall it‚Äôs great. 

But

I am just staggered by the number of bad, leaky containers with soaking wet logs. As a matter of habit I try to go for the more fun caches around and avoid most of the P&amp;G, lamp post, guardrail types. But even places where you would expect a nice sized traditional with full-size log book and nice dry container, like a off a secluded trail in the woods; instead you find a pill bottle with mushy toilet paper for a log. I just don‚Äôt understand. I consider it a source of pride that even with caches in place for 7-10 years I have never had a wet log. You would think that picking a good container up front would save time on maintenance too, this series we found today is just over a year old and most of them needed new logs already. It‚Äôs just ridiculous. 


I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for answers or just talking out loud but it‚Äôs frustrating. Because there are some amazing hiders near me and I love seeking those out. But it seems like half the caches and 2-3 CO‚Äôs I just have to blacklist because it‚Äôs so disappointing.

If a cache is in a shopping centre parking lot in the Mid West for eg, would some cachers feel it best to not try it at night for fear of attracting (obviously unfair) attention that a person of another ethnicity might not attract in the exact same circumstances?

There are caches I didn't know about from the lonely crag near where I was born to the castle ruins hidden in the Austrian forest. In every city I've been to and in most cities I'll ever visit.

More than ever, I feel this dizziness that comes with the helpless realisation that there's an infinity of things I'd like to do but will never be able to. Not that this fear of missing out is something new, but finding out that even in the places I've visited, I missed stuff that significant is giving me a strong sense of existential dread.

"Hey guys! I've been a paying member for several years, and recently finally cancelled my membership.

I had a cache that I disabled due to bees nearby and one finder getting stung. I logged a Temp Disable, noting that I would check back on it in a  while and update.

Well, the local reviewer made a log month later and said I was ""non-communicating"" (I never heard from Groundspeak about it) and he archived it. He explicitly said that I could *have it unarchived* *later*. No loss, I get it. So, after some family issues (a death) I finally make plans and take a day off work, get the family together, we go out and update all my caches after the winter (I have a few caches I regularly maintain), update all and fix up the one I had disabled. I emailed support when I got home asking to have it unarchived.

The reply was a snide one-line response that said no way can they unarchive a cache. In reply, I, again politely, quote the reviewer where he said I could have it unarchived. Again, a snooty reply telling me I'm SOL (from the same guy). I reply back that I'm disappointed because I'll lose all my logs and also my frustration that the reviewer effectively deceived me. This time Groundspeak doesn't even have the courtesy to reply.

They *told me* they'd unarchive it on request, I took a day off work, prepped everything, and got a couple snide replies, and then get ignored. I was polite throughout. I used to be excited about geocaching as a sort of earth-friendly, explore-the-unknown, contribute to the caching community sort of mentality, but this has really soured me. I'll still cache because it's still fun, but the experience is super frustrating and honestly a real let down. I've cancelled my membership in the meantime and am not sure I'll start it up again.

Of course there's the Terrain rating, but the meaning of the rating just seems too broad. Terrain 3 can mean significant elevation changes, or it can mean significant overgrowth. But it's a totally different thing to be prepared to climb 50 feet up a grassy hill vs. to cut through 50 feet of thick ground cover and spider webs.

Allocate was primarily designed for geocaching. A key point of the app is the calculation of mathematical equations hidden in coordinate data. Thus, in the forest, the solution no longer has to be laboriously derived in the head, but comfortably via app. Another highlight is dealing with unknown variables, which you could not find or forgot to note down. In this case, simply enter a number range. All possible combinations are calculated and conveniently displayed on the map. Thus, it is clear at first glance, which solutions make sense and which are definitely to be excluded.

"Hi!
This is just a idea for a cache I got. I might be bad or dangerous so I thought that I‚Äôd ask for some response here. 

My thought was to make a difficult cache, which would be attached to the ‚Äútop‚Äù of a railway crossing gate. 
The point of that is that the cache only would be accessible when the gate is lowered so that you kind of would have to time it in. When the gate is rises the cache will be up high. 

I do totally understand that I cannot do this at a railwaycrossing next to a place where trains passes rapidly. Will should never stand close to the gate then. 

My thought was to put it on a rising gate however, not necessarily next to a railway. That was just as a example.

"So I've recently gotten back into geocaching, after a few months break. Like I always do about every month or so I went to do a check up on some geocaches near my house; I live on a corner and both roads have a decent amount of caches.

I noticed as I was making my run, a few geocaches weren't showing up in the app. But I remembered where they were and said that they were in near perfect condition for the age and location. I went along my route and added new logs, replaced broken containers and everything I normally do when I make my maintenance run. These aren't my caches but the owner is in poor health and I try to keep them in decent condition and has always thanked me after I do a run like this since he can't get out and do it himself.

Now I've haven't done one of these runs in about 5 or 6 months, so when I got back home to see what the deal was about with the caches that weren't showing up, I saw that they were archived. The archive message said 'cant maintain them, archive them.' After scrolling threw some of this archives I saw it was because of his age and health, he can keep up being a decent cache owner anymore. Which is fine and reasonable, so I decided to message him by email and threw the websites messaging service to see if I can ""adopt"" some of the caches. The ones near my house that I typically maintain anyways, especially since some of them are some of close to me since I have my first cache , FTF and so on with some of these caches. I sent how to do the adoption process and links and all. This was about a week ago

This morning I received an email that only said ""Sorry, ment to archive"" and added a cache code of a cache I replaced a log of. Okay. So I checked his profile and he archived over 100 geocaches that he owned. Which is fine, he can do that their his caches. But he didn't make an effort to use the adoption process so not all of them had to go away. Now this took a large bit of caches in the county I live in away from use, about 1/4 of the caches.

"Hi, I started geocaching a little over a month ago, and so far I have logged 185 caches. I have really enjoyed it, and my time doing it has mostly been without issues. Now there is a single thing I found that is kind of annoying and that is logging trackable visits. 

I have been caching using the official Geocaching smartphone app, and writing the log right after finding a cache, and the problem is that the app doesn't have the nice drop-down menu with selection for ""visited"" and ""dropped off"" that you get when logging through the website. So, what I end up having to do, after I'm done geocaching and back home, is to edit my logs one by one through the website to add the TB visit, which can get really annoying if you've visited more than a few caches during the day.

My question is, is there a way to log a TB visit to multiple caches at once?",Is there a way to log multiple trackable visits at once?,geocaching

"I was first exposed to geocaching in high school about 7 years ago. I've wanted to get into it, but I was worried that nobody would want to do it with me because they'd think it was dumb. I told my husband about it a week ago and now he loves it. We've gone on geocaching adventures twice so far. My little sister is also super keen, and wants to come with us. I told my best friend about it on Sunday, and she was so excited about it that we went out geocaching then and there. Yesterday she called me saying that her shift at work was cancelled and she had some time, and asked if I could please go geocaching with her. She then told her friend as well as her dad's girlfriend. Now all these people want to form a group so we can do it together. I guess I should have mentioned my interest in geocaching years ago

Just now I clicked on the CO's name and it has them listed as an inactive cacher. Someone logged a NM two years ago, citing the fact that there was no container - the baggie and the current log were added by another finder, and it looks like before this incarnation, others were adding their own slips of paper.

I've been tracking some caches that have been found recently, but I'm coming up dry over and over. Does anyone have any suggestions?

"If you find a cache a good distance from the listed coords, what do you write in the logs about it, if anything?  

Your GPS is not as accurate as your probably think it is.  There are many ways GPS gets errors, and some of them are inherant on any particular time especially with limited sky availability.  So I don't assume the coords are wrong.  I might log something like ""My GPS read 45 feet to the SW of the listed coords"".  Often that helps other searchers, but sometimes future cachers will say that their GPS was right on spot for the hide.

"UPDATE: Apparently the consensus is that CO‚Äôs enjoy filling their caches. However, there are a few that don‚Äôt agree and have a **bad** attitude about it too. 

I‚Äôm curious what the consensus is when hiding a container large enough for swag/items to trade, do you hide it with some items to trade or leave it empty in hopes some geocachers will leave behind items that subsequent geocachers can trade?  

I ask because I thought the obvious answer was the latter, however, there‚Äôs a local who has over 100 hides and I‚Äôve noticed he hides containers and ammo cans with only a log or an occasional quarter for the FTF. The first new-ish one I found (found a week after it was hid), I thought it got muggled. But I‚Äôve seen others were the cache description says, ‚ÄúPlenty of room for swag. Left quarter for FTF to start it off.‚Äù 

I suppose it might get expensive if you have a lot hides but I get annoyed when I find empty containers and will usually leave a good amount of tradables to the game fun for the kids and those that like to trade.

Before you do, I'm here to tell you a bit more about cache ownership. The darker side of it. To hopefully prepare you for it. Two rules for cache ownership that are kind of hard to swallow, but none the less must be accepted:

1. No matter the quality or condition of a cache, someone will be displeased with some aspect of it. 
2. You will be blamed for conditions outside of your control, including other people's actions.

Use a nano? Some people will complain that it's not large. Use a large? Some people will complain about the swag, or location. Use what you consider the perfect location with amazing swag? People will simply not agree. Fairly easy one this one... You can't please all the people all of the time.

Stock your cache with the most luscious items available, the tragedy of the commons will occur, and eventually, you will be left with a cache with nothing or next to nothing. Even before that however, if you stock it with gold... Some people will prefer diamonds. 

Go out of your way to create a cache that's unique and attracts more attention? Expect problems to be amplified exponentially. The more visits a cache receives, the higher the likelihood of problems and the faster rule #2 will occur.  

Even if you maintain your cache regularly, it simply takes one poor cacher for you to receive the blame. Cacher cleaned out all the swag, didn't log a travel bug, or otherwise caused the cache to have some negative? You will not be normally aware of this until the next cacher reports it. In most cases, you will not be able to correct the situation that was outside of your control either. (As a travel bug hotel owner, I have more than once been blamed for travel bugs that have gone missing.)

I still feel that creating caches that bring so much joy is worth it! Nobody likes to talk about this end of cache ownership, but I feel a bit of education may help those that face it in the future. Develop a little thicker skin right now, and hopefully, by accepting these rules you will be better able to do what I'm still learning right now: To not take these things so personally. Happy caching all!  ",The dark side of owning a cache...,geocaching

"Hi all! My husband and I both used to geocache with family (separately) when we were kids and have recently gotten back into it together. Even though we‚Äôve both got some experience, I still consider us beginners and fairly inexperienced. 

A couple questions... 

We have the geocache app on our phones which has a ‚ÄúGPS‚Äù tracking system, though we‚Äôve found it to be relatively unreliable. We will get within 50 ft and all the sudden it‚Äôll say 25 ft further from where it had just said. I understand you get to a point where you stop relying on the GPS and start looking... however, we‚Äôre considering getting an actual handheld GPS. Not a crazy fancy, $500 GPS (yet). We found one on amazon for $90. Is it worth the investment? Or should we stick with our phones? 

Also, we‚Äôve found a few that have things to trade... but everything left inside is usually junk. I‚Äôve seen the jokes about how geocaching is ‚Äúhiding trash‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt think it was literal. We actually found a cache at a graveyard entrance that literally had a cigarette in it. We considered getting a small collection of stuff to trade but all the crap in geocaches are gross, dirty, and seem like actual trash. Is this pretty common? Do you trade often?

But as you move out of cities and into more wooded areas you have so many more options! For just a few dollars you can buy \(or just reuse\) a small container or something larger. A small size upgrade from a micro to a small container allows for trade items to be found and placed. Just a little swag makes the experience so much more enjoyable!

"I need some help coming up with an idea. Just over a week ago, my sister-in-law texted me that she had a dream I was pregnant and I used a geocache to tell people.

Any ideas for a way to stage a geocache and show her on Skype?

My current ideas:

Tell her that her comment about geocaching made me finally want to go set up my own. Show her the fake cache I made with something (like what?) inside that tells her I'm pregnant. (Possible downside: she might tell me not to show her because she wants to find it next time they come up.)

Show her a real cache with ""this weird thing"" that I found inside (the pregnancy announcement).

Any other/better ideas? I know there are caches where you have to answer a few questions first or whatnot (sorry, I don't know the terms since I'm super casual and have only ever done really basic level 1 &amp; 2 caches mostly). I worry that if I get too elaborate, she'll get suspicious and guess early. I won't rule that sort of thing out though--I could pretend I'm asking for help with a clue I found or something.

"I'm new to geochaching. My kids (13yo &amp; 17yo [w/mental disabilities so she's more like a 10yo]) and I started recently. I found out about it and thought they'd enjoy it.

We've gone out a few times and found a few really easy ones, but only about 10% of the ones we've looked for. We're in a town that was supposedly rated one of the best geocaching towns a couple of years ago. 

The problem is I think either the cache owners OR i myself is missing the point. Almost every cache around here is described as a micro-cache, ""a pill bottle wrapped in camouflage tape"". Then they've hidden it in the most obscure places: a hole in a rotten log that's now filled in with leaves, or wedged under the roots of a tree next to a storm drain by a lake, or 50' into the woods at the base of some tree surrounded by a sea of poison ivy. Then the cache hiders leave little-to-no clues as to the location and poor GPS coordinates. Some seem to take a sadistic pleasure in leaving the most cryptic descriptions they can think of that really give you no clue as to where it is or even what you're looking for.

I thought the point was too have fun hunting and FINDING little hidden ""treasure boxes"" and signing the log to show that you found it. How is hiding the tiniest possible container in a location Indiana Jones himself couldn't find and then leaving vague or misleading clues fun for these people? My kids have lost complete interest and don't want to go anymore because we have such little success. We just seen to wander around in the woods trying not to get poison ivy and seldom fine anything. Even the apps I'm using are terrible at helping locate the cache ""you're 50' away, 47', 40', 33'..... And now you're 87' feet away.

Am I missing the point? We look and look, seldom find anything, and the cache owners are hiding tiny caches and hiding them so well you'd think they contained national secrets. What's with the ""how hard can we make this to find"" mentality? Where are the lunch pail sized tins/containers that say ""geocache"" on them that I see pictures of on the internet? Is it FUN to hide something that's near impossible to find? Wouldn't it be more fun for families to actually find the things?

I'm trying to salvage some interest here for me and my kids, but I'm failing.

Edit:
 1) I'm really appreciating all of these responses. (This crowd seems unusually friendly for a subReddit!) I'm going to try several of your suggestions. I'm not giving up yet! 

2) I've been using the filters and sticking to difficulty 1 to 2. 

3)We live in a suburban area with about 100 miles of paved walking/biking/golf cart trails through the woods between neighborhoods. Most everything has seemed to be hidden in the woods away from the paths and they've all been the ""micro containers"" that have just been near impossible to find. No trinkets or anything inside - and that's completely fine to us because that's all we've experienced so my kids aren't expecting anything but a signature page/logbook.

4) I'll definitely try searching some out on my own and then take the kids back after I've (hopefully) found them and let the kids try with me trying to discreetly steer them towards the cache. I'll also try messaging the CO for hints.

"Hi. I would like to know what do you guys think about this cache that i'm about to place.
There's a walkling path in my city, close to the zoo. This walking path is surounded by light poles, and some light poles were removed sometime ago, leaving behind a hole in the ground and two wires sticking out this hole (those wires aren't live wires). Some holes don't have such wires, so i had an idea of buying the same type of wire, and electrical conduit used in the other holes, putting the wires inside one side of the conduit (in a way that they stick out), and putting a cache to the other side, then i would place all of this inside a hole that don't have a wire sticking out and it would be a really good camouflage.
My question is if this cache would be according to the rules, and also if it's bad to instigate people to search for caches in dangerous situations like that, because in my case i'm sure the wires aren't live, but who knows, after finding my cache a geocacher can go to another cache that has lose wires close to it and try to find a cache there and get an electric shock.",Is it a good idea for a cache?,geocaching

"I'm new to geocaching (started in February) and I have come across a few caches that are in need of maintenance and have owners that haven't logged into the site in years. I know there are two choices: do the maintenance yourself if you have the means/times or log a NM on the site and let the cache eventually be archived.

But my question is this: which is better for the geocaching community? Is it better to do maintenance on abandoned caches as you find them in the hopes that they stick around longer and more people can enjoy them? Or is it better to have these caches archived to ""clean up"" the listings and allow for caches to be put out that are actively being watched by their owners? I'm just curious as to what everyone's opinion is on this.

(One of the reasons I ask is I found a cache in a tiny little town that only has about five caches total - most of which are missing. This cache needs to be completely replaced as the container is broken and the insides are mush. I'm happy to do it since there are so few caches in this town. But I just am curious as to the etiquette of replacing a whole cache that's been abandoned).

"Long-time cacher, used to have a lot of fun with it. Was able to find some things that I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. Haven't cached in the past coupe of years- partly because my son isn't as interested as he used to be, partly because I've been busy, and let's not forget the changes to the app. Most of my caches were found with my phone, when I had a few minutes while driving around.

Getting ready for a road trip with my son, I decide to re-up my subscription to Geocaching and download some caches to my GPS. IMMEDIATELY after my transaction clears, I get logged out and a system error keeps me from logging back in. I assume it's bad luck on my part, so I have to ask- how often do the servers go down? Is this a normal thing? If so, how long can I expect the error to keep occurring?

"I had to archive my daughter's and my favorite cache yesterday after it became obvious that it was being specifically targeted for vandalism. In the slightly-less-than-two-years it was hidden it had three different hiding places, racked up 17 finds, got 7 favorite points, and was vandalized about 5-6 times. Its most recent hiding place was legitimate *nowhere* near where anyone would go. There are no nearby trails, it's not en route between any two significant points, and it was almost literally invisible unless you were about 10-15 feet away and only then from a specific angle *if* you knew what to look for. IMO, the cache was specifically targeted by someone.

I have no proof but I do have a suspicion. There's a fairly deranged (IMO) individual in my area who was a chronic armchair geocacher and I was one of the people who called him out and reported him to Groundspeak for cheating. Shortly  thereafter several of my caches (and a few caches from others who similarly reported him) got vandalized. Can't prove anything, but the timing is certainly suspicious.

"To give away some meta information: I do geocaching a bit more than a year, have ~200 finds and just hid my first cache (a mystery) last week. Last year in March I found a D2/T4 geocache not far away from where I live. The place where it's hidden is just beautiful with a magnific view.

Today I stumbled over the same cache again while looking for new caches to find. There is a pending Needs-Maintenance-log which has been submitted in 2012. The cache has never been maintained since 2006, when it was published. I checked if the owner is still active and it seems like he stopped participating in geocaching. Last login in September 2016, and last activity (a Found on another geocache) in 2011.

To find said geocache, you have to climb up a lightning rod, which is pretty damaged already. I think it's just a matter of time until someone tears it out. Not the best spot to hide a cache imho.

Now I want to adopt this cache, because the place there is really worth a visit and deserves a geocache, but there are better spots to hide it. I have read that an adoption can ONLY be initiated by an owner. My question is: How can I process now? I have following possibilities:

1) Messaging the owner and requesting him to start the adoption process. The problem is, he is inactive at the moment and it doesn't look like he cares about the hobby anymore. Although I have little to no chances to have the adoption process initiated, this is the first step I WILL try.

2) Post a second Needs-Maintenance-log, followed by a Needs-archived-log a couple of weeks later. But I don't think that this is a good solution, because if someone really tears out the lightning rod, the fall could cause serious injuries. I know there is a risk in doing geocaching, but it just doesn't need to happen.

3) Remove the cache, wait for some DNF-logs and then post a Needs-archived-log. I highly reject this solution and I know it is strongly prohibited! I just post this here because I don't want users to come up with this in the comments.

4) Messaging my local reviewer and ask him if he can do anything. This is something I will do, simultaneously to contacting the cache owner.

"Hi,
this idea I placed in gameideas yesterday, so maybe you have read it before, but I don‚Äòt think these two communities have much points of contact.
I am completely new to reddit and my raw idea of a outdoor game was the reason to take part here. The idea i would like to see is a smartphone app outdoor game, like pokemon go, but not with that however battle part. Just be outside and find some nice places and enjoy fresh air.

The game is splitted in two parts. 

Part 1: myplaces
First explore your own living place and make photos in the app of your places you like to show others. Maybe a strange house, monuments, places of interests, lookout, bars, filling stations, memorial tablet, everything you find interesting and can be interesting to others. If you want give some hints, some personal words, what the place means to you. But these places should be permanent, not moving around or not possible to carry away. Maybe some things are carried in house in winter, not good to find :). These places are shared with geodetic coordinates to be found by others. 

Part 2: Iwashere
Step out of your car, unmount your bike or walk some way from your place to have a new exciting starting point.  Enter a time period or a length in meters/kilometers you like to walk. The app gives you choices to other peoples places you can walk to and make a photo of that place as prove. Maybe give thumps up, give comments to them. The app shows you next interesting place you can go and time/length to your origin point, so you can be shure to reach your origin in time back and find your car/bike/train, whatever. The track you can see later in a history map.

There are still outdoor games, I know. But to battle at the destination to complete aim is not my ambition.  Maybe someone enjoy the idea or feels inspired to create the app, or have comments, or give me a hint if the game already exists.

But browsing my nearby multis (with very similar instructions of ""count/read this and then do this arithmetic""), I saw that none of them had coord checkers in the listing. I also saw that there's now a coord checker built-in to the main gc.com site... but it's restricted to mystery caches.

"The may get long but I‚Äôve had a year‚Äôs worth of time and some long hikes to ponder. 

It started by accident on vacation so ten straight days. Got back and it‚Äôs slow season at work so hit a month, then a business trip to two states I didn‚Äôt have souvenirs and pretty soon I was at 50 days. I‚Äôd done 100 days a couple years back so why not go for it? Then why not beat it so I went for 200. On day 201 just kept going. Then I saw a 365 day challenge cache near something I was targeting. Then I noticed 3/2 would be day 365 and also the final white square on the calendar. Had to go for it.  

I see a lot of grumbling about Lamp Post, Rock wall and Guard rails. After a while they do get boring but now I realize a quest like this probably can‚Äôt happen without them. Some days you‚Äôre sick. Some days you don‚Äôt have time to risk a DNF search on a lunch break. Some days the weather is seriously crappy and bless you for putting a lamppost in a big parking lot. I might just put a couple of these out there myself and quit complaining. 

I‚Äôve also seen and talked to a lot of people complaining about Groundspeak. I have some issues but if not them, who? I don‚Äôt want to get into a debate about premium pricing and the App but also to make 365 happen, you‚Äôre going to need a premium account. I appreciate what they do though they could do better. Even if they give me every feature I want someone will have some other thing they also want that isn‚Äôt there. And everyone wants it cheaper. 

Which brings me to...Premium caches. Little story, I know a fellow cacher who is constantly on Groundspeak for ruining caching and the decline in active cachers and attendance at Mega events dropping is all their fault. Cool, how come 100% of your hides are premium?  If Groundspeak is the problem in your mind why make everyone pay them to play with you?

"I was recently walking down a trail near my house. I decided to wander around a cache-free area to see if there were any good hide locations around there.

I stumbled across something really cool/unique in the woods and just knew I had to put a cache there to bring people to the location. I double checked the map and it looked like there was open space. So, I placed a cache and submitted it.

It was soon rejected for being about 100 feet away from the hidden final for a puzzle cache. I was curious about that cache, so I went to find it. Once there, I realized that people wouldn't see the location I wanted them to see.

I was super disappointed, retrieved my cache, and archived my submission.

Now I know I can't hide a physical cache there, but it later occurred to me that I could create a multi and put a virtual stage there instead and hide a final somewhere else. My gut says that's kinda lame and against the spirit of the geocache density rules though.

"There's a mystery cache not too far from me. The solution to the puzzle gives the location of the cache, but in *paces*. I'm told to go &lt;x&gt; paces north and then &lt;y&gt; paces east. The listing has a GeoCheck coordinate checker on it which has a roughly 13% success rate, and people *are* logging finds. I just don't know how they do it.

I know, I know, the obvious answer is, ""Go to the posted coordinates, then go &lt;x&gt; paces north and then &lt;y&gt; paces east."" The problem with that is the posted coordinates are nowhere near a path so how do you measure ""one pace north"" or ""one pace east"" when you're on hills and stepping around trees and such? And none of the trails in the area run in true directions either so it's not that simple.

I found some online tools to help me calculate a projected location based on distance from a GPS coordinate, but without knowing how long a ""pace"" is supposed to be I'm just guessing with random numbers. I tried everywhere from the assumption of 2.5 feet all the way to 6 feet (in 6"" increments) but GeoCheck says no joy.

But others have done it so there has to be a way to measure a ""pace"" accurately enough to be able to generate coordinates that are good enough for GeoCheck. But how do you do it?",How do you measure a pace?,geocaching

"So this is a late night detective story with a TL:DR at the end. This one might be a little long but I found the entire thing quite interesting and a good diversion. I'm on a 12 hour night watch and as I often do I solved some puzzles, planned out geo-caching road trips, looked at find maps, and in general revel in the beauty of statistics.

As I did so I checked out my county progress over on Project-GC. It's one of my favorite parts of Geocaching - tracking where I've been by where I've found caches. It's been one of my favorite aspects of the hobby since I started back in 2012 and it's helped me explore a lot of new places! So as I examine that map and ponder where my next road trip should take me I noticed a hole in my counties down in the Florida Panhandle. 

My first thought was ""I could've sworn I found a cache there."" Could I be going crazy and losing my mind? I went back through my emails and verified that I hadn't received any deleted logs. Nope; no deletions!

So now I had to think... did I actually find a cache there? Where could I find a historical counties map since the current one obviously showed a hole. I recalled a Continuous Counties Challenge Cache I found back in 2016 and sleuthed my way back to the cache page. My now two-year old log happened to include a picture as evidence of my cache completion... and YES the county had previously been found!

What could have happened? I remember for that trip I had been traveling from Atlanta to Pensacola for a Wetting Down Ceremony so I found my logs from that road trip to determine the route I took. Knowing I was along a back road (to travel through some new counties) I began scouring the map.

Low and behold I found the culprit! A cache that I had reported as damaged (hit by a lawn mower and chewed up to pieces) had been replaced! The owner had performed maintenance two times since I visited back in 2015 and after having the cache destroyed again, he moved it from one field across the street to a wood strand.

Can you see where this story is headed yet? GC2EQFP ""Trouble at the State Line"" was my first cache in the State of Florida... and it was right over the state line in Florida, but when the CO relocated the cache to keep it in play, he moved it out of Florida (and out of the county) and into Alabama!

Needless to say I was ecstatic to make the discovery; mostly because it proved that 1) I was not crazy and mis-remembering that trip and 2) that I hadn't had a log deleted without my knowing. 

The lesson I learned is this: always make sure to find more than one cache per county.... or at least not one so close to the state line! My sleuthing skills helped kill a few hours of work AND uncovered a mystery!

TL:DR - CO moved a cache 90' to preserve the hide and in the process moved it across the state line!",A Late Night Detective Story...,geocaching

"I live on a farm in Ontario, we raise sheep and chickens, and have some barn cats which keep the mice population down. And for the last few seasons something has baffled me.

Every once in a while, sometimes weeks, sometimes days, someone would show up, park beside our property, and then go for a walk down the old railroad tracks. This of course would upset our dogs or our neighbors dogs and caused us some trouble.

It was never the same person, and they usually left within the hour. It would even happen on really cold winter days. I never understood it, as the track is not very appealing visually and the only interesting things I have ever found there, have been old rail spikes or lumps of coal from when it used to be a train track.

And yesterday I figured it out. I took my dog for a walk down the tracks as I usually do, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked at it and wondered why the hell that thing was where it was. So being the nosy tit I was, I went and had a look. I opened it and lo and behold there was a piece of paper inside.

When I opened the paper, the very first thing I saw was Geocache. You people have been causing us trouble for the last while because of this silly little thing. I can't count the times I had to listen to our dogs, or the neighbors dogs bark up a storm because someone parked their car at the edge of our property and just went up the track looking for this thing.

Now I haven't touched it and I'm not going to say anything about what it was or where it is, but for the love of god, please think about the people living near these things. Also it may be a game to you, but we've had troubles with coyotes the last while and they do use those tracks so stay away from them in the dark hours.

I know with the right extensions I can send the cach right to the unit but a brief overview would really be appreciated and i can focus in in details after! I also hear there are free topo maps.  I saw some caches loaded on the unit from old owner and it looks amazing the info that is included!! I am very excited.  I am more interested in using this then the phone.

"I have always wanted to own my own businesses, but I have no idea how to go about it.

At the present time, I am drowning in debt, and I intend to pay it off before I even attempt a business.  This gives me about two years to learn and plan.

Here are a few questions I have:

- Do I need to love *all* coffee to own a coffee shop?  For example, I really am not a huge fan of black coffee.  I know I can learn to like it (I am actually forcing myself through a cup-a-day).  Is this necessary?

- I have no background in coffee at all.  I just like fancy drinks that taste delicious - and coffee-beverages are my favorite.  What steps do I need to take to become an expert in coffee?

- Should I try to fund the business completely myself?  Or should I find backers?  I'm worried that if I find a bunch of backers and then the business fails, I'll be in the hole a lot of money - however if I fund it myself, I'll be in the hole a lot of money either way (at least until the business pays itself off).

- Finally, I simply don't know where to start.  Any tips?

I definitely would consider myself a fluent speaker, but sometimes when I have conversations in Spanish I am not very confident with more advanced sentences. 

For example, today on the phone with somebody I wanted to say ‚ÄúThat is an excellent idea and I am planning on doing that as soon as possible‚Äù, and I had some trouble forming that. I said ‚ÄúEso es una buen idea y lo voy hacer ahorita‚Äù, which just translates to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good idea and I‚Äôm gonna do it now‚Äù.

"**For better understanding, I've edited the original post to include more information about myself and the project at end.**

&amp;#x200B;

You may call me Libensborn, Im 30.

Over the past 5 years, I've been owner of a company inserted within the packaging design and production sector, even though I carry around 10 years of expertise in the field. Through sheer effort and dedication, this company has beens teadily growing at a rate of 35% per year.

Like this project, no one believed we would carry on for so long and so far, and we haven't even began the real investement. Although, all it was needed were two things for it to come to life: vision and belief, and money of course, but if you have the first two aspects...you'll surpass any obstacle to reach your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to explain the project at hand.

Eversince I was 12, I've always been a passionate gamer, playing all kind of genres, which passed from FPS and RTS to just MMMORPGs, in which the top ones I've played and loved are games such as Guild Wars, SWG, SWTOR, Black Desert, Eve Online...along those lines.

‚ÄãThe thing is that, like everything in life, you can't hope to have everything to be perfect. Well...these MMOs I've just mentioned weren't certainly perfect, others more than others, and it felt there was always something missing, and everything I thought about was ""if I ever designed an MMO, it would have the best of them and pretty much none of the flaws (at the mechanics level at least).

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄãTaking this ""gamer experience"" into hands and watching what most of the gamer community loved and hated in the MMORPG genre out there; me and a long-time friend (gamer as well), decided to put our minds and hands to work. We've decided that we wanted a game that would one day be a ""AAA"" MMORPG, with revolutionary features.

Slowly we've started to compile a story, races, locations, layouts, mechanics, engine to be used and everything the basis of a game has.

There was just one problem! We don't have any developer skills of coding, back-end management experience, etc. So what to do?! We've began to recruit professionals with the needed skills: coders, 3d and 2d artists, screenwriters, creative director...these people accepted to join just due to the the idea itself.

Of course, we're still in need of filling some brackets, but these professionals also know who to contact to fill in the blanks.

‚ÄãSince the creation of this post, we've began the compilation of the story line, and making the conceptualization of the game itself will start in a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all of the stated above, we still need heading. We need a phased development strategy, possibility of out-sourcing (there's a studio near my location that is growing and near to release its first AAA game), we still need to decide on which engine to use (we're currently deciding between, Unreal, Cryengine or Hero), etc.

‚Äã

We would kindly accept the input of anyone with experience on the processes involving this subject, or any general valid opinions/suggestions and criticism.

‚ÄãI know most will call this a farfetched dream, but if you don't pursue your dreams...no else will. ;)

‚Äã

Thanks in advance

&amp;#x200B;

I want / need to learn the basic economic stuff so I can prepare myself to what is called ""adult life"", so I won't live in debt most of the times.

**Have in mind that I already** **read The Rich Dad Poor Day... book and I'm kinda (just kinda) not 100% interested in investing (at least for now, because I have graduation as my next chapter of my life).** 

In my mind it makes sense that everyone needs to learn the basic stuff, those crazy words that  banks and the news always talk about, since we don't learn anything related to that in school (90% of the times, at least I didn't).

Plus, I have the mentality that every penny I spent, will somewhere in the future, choose if I can buy this or not, if I will lose money or live problem free in this situation.

After a few minutes of research I came along of a bunch of complicated topics and outdated books or ones with a lot of critics (as the case of Thomas Sowell books) and I don't seem to find the ""right one"".

With this I mean, I really don't want to risk a lot, at least right now because I don't have much money (risk is fun and I will eventually be forced to do it of course), but I don't want to be millionare with 1000$ investment, no. I want to live a ""normal"" life without the common money problems because people are not educated in economics or are simply dumb.

I think I overthink everything. like if I talk to someone on discord and if their name goes name, I wonder if they blocked me, and get upset if they really did. even if they didnt, I wonder why they didnt message me when they said they would. and have the emotion to purge everyone and talk to other people and leave them all. everyday I wake up tired frustrated and wish I never have to feel this way I keep going, however due to reasons I am still here then get upset I am being forced the stay. then think of other things like i have to get a job meaning I have to deal with people when I am scared to death. then think of how awkward with everyone also never want to maintain a relationship. which leads to questions like workplace politics also how to please the boss to get a promotion, then I have to be on good terms with co-workers, Ive never even liked to eat lunch with people back in high school. then I think of the so many years ahead of me. then i cry again. then remembers I cant even tell the differences between certain vowels like e and a. how everyone will laugh at me looking at me like a clown. then I think of how pointless my life is, then I think of how I am forced to stay again, then i think of my future... I get upset and always have the purge to just fuck it all and tell the world maybe i just dont give a f. however i remembered I cant because I will have to face these people everyday. and have to consider the consequences. cant even express my opinions openly and publicly cuz dude what if someone doesnt agree with me what if she or he will be critical in my future? look what I caution has brought me. kinda feel like the black mirror one episode where people all had s score for life. I wish maybe one day I can just stand up and tell everyone to piss off. however if that i will have a 0 score and go down the dark road. like i was cornered by a group of guys before, I wanted to just say I will go down and take u all out. but I didnt. I could've been physical, but i cried. cuz yeah what if it leaves me a record? what if they sue me? then I will never get a job tho I was the victim. was blackmailed by guys before but instead of going to the cops or court, i paid them off. I thought what if even tho I won people think why I got in these things in the first place? had people waiting for me outside out school with a knife, yeah I called a lawyer up asking if I could fend them out as self-defence. lawyer told me to not make a move cuz I might get in trouble. yeah so I just wait till they slit my throat? once had a guy blackmailing me for 400 dollars, I called the lawyer because it was all lie and i have evidence, lawyer told me to just pay him off cuz it would cost me more to get a lawyer. so I paid him off. all the crap I have to put up with, i feel useless yet cant do much. when can I just say I dont give a fuck about my record and just do what I want

"I'm going to teach you the top five lessons from the book ‚ÄúModels‚Äù by Mark Manson.

The tagline of the book is ‚Äúhow to attract women through honesty‚Äù while it definitely teaches this it doesn‚Äôt mean if you have a girlfriend the lessons aren‚Äôt useful. The lessons will also teach you how to be more charismatic and confident around anyone you meet not just women. The lesson will work for anyone trying to attract anyone no matter what sexuality or gender.

**Lesson one don't be needy**

You need to be happy with who you are.

If you are needy you do things to impress others.

Mark Manson says ‚Äúall performance is neediness‚Äù

To stop being needy do things because you enjoy doing them and for no other reason

Be comfortable with who you are and don‚Äôt look to anyone else for approval.

You don‚Äôt need the approval of others just the approval of yourself. One needy behaviour is sending too many text messages.

Mark Manson says that texts should be used to arrange dates and that‚Äôs about it, they should be used to arrange real life interactions.

Also, a non needy man will stick to what he believes in even if it doesn‚Äôt match what the others around him believe.

Don‚Äôt be disrespectful to the people around you but don‚Äôt just go along with the crowd.

Be invested in yourself and what you believe in.

This isn‚Äôt to say be horrible to others - you 100% should care about other people just stick to what you believe in respectfully.

Allow others to have their own opinion on things and allow yourself to have your own as well.

Don‚Äôt worry about rejection - Mark Manson says ‚Äúrejection exists for a reason ‚Äî it‚Äôs a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other‚Äù

**Lesson two: Show your vulnerable side**

Most people try their hardest not to look stupid. Men think to attract a woman you‚Äôve got to be as macho as possible and make no mistakes.

The thing is women don't actually mind if you make mistakes or look stupid, what actually matters is how you react to looking stupid.

You see ‚ÄúHumans are attracted to each other‚Äôs rough edges.‚Äù

If you make a mistake or say something wrong and just laugh it off it shows that you have enough self esteem that small things like this don‚Äôt bother you.

Nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes. By you being vulnerable others around you will relax because they know they don‚Äôt have to be perfect either.

So talk about things that you‚Äôre truly passionate about not just small talk even if you talk about mistakes you‚Äôve made in don‚Äôt worry about trying to cover up your rough edges.

If you try to have deeper, more meaningful conversations more often you will form stronger relationships much faster.

If you‚Äôre talking to someone and say something stupid just laugh it off.

**Lesson 3: have an attractive lifestyle**

Actions speak louder than words.

If you concentrate all your energy on the best lines to say to someone in the hope of impressing her but then you actually lead an unattractive lifestyle then you might be able to attract the them initially but before long you lifestyle will put them off and you‚Äôll become unattractive to them.

A big misconception is that the majority of your attraction comes from your natural looks.

Physical appearance is one area of attraction but your lifestyle as a whole is more important.

What lifestyle would someone else most like to be part of?

If you have a relationship with someone who is really attractive, they drive a nice car and have a good job but they also work 50 hours a week you might be attracted to them initially but eventually because they work all the time you won‚Äôt get to see them so their lifestyle will put you off.

So how do you make your lifestyle more attractive?

In my opinion the most attractive lives for the majority of people involve 2 things.

Freedom and time. To me the most attractive lifestyle is doing what you love, when you love with who you love.

How do you do that?

One simple aim, get your passive income higher than your expenses.

If you are not sure exactly what this means I would recommend listening to rich dad poor dad by robert t kiyosaki.

When you passive income is higher than your expenses you won‚Äôt have to work and that way you will have a lot of time to work on what you actually love.

**Lesson 4: Make assumptions rather than asking questions.**

Have you ever been in a situation where someone is talking to you but it feels more like an interview?

All they are doing is asking questions and it's not fun to be part of.

To avoid this is you want to talk in terms of statements.

Make assumptions about the other person.

Rather than asking what do you do for a living?

Say ‚ÄúYou seem like a great person, I bet your job is interesting.‚Äù

Instead of how do you guys know each other?

Say ‚ÄúYou guys look like you‚Äôve been friends for a long time.

Instead of What hobbies do you have?

Say ‚ÄúYou look like someone who is really into sport‚Äù

This is called cold reading and it‚Äôs just making educated guesses about another person.

Mark Manson says you should cold read with women as much as possible.

Most people would be worried about doing this because what if you get it wrong.

The reason it works so well is because it doesn‚Äôt matter if you get it wrong.

When you cold read 1 of 3 things will happen:

1. You‚Äôll get it wrong and they will correct you - this means that they will just answer the question that you based your cold read on.
2. You get it wrong and the other person is intrigued and wants to know why you thought that.
3. You get it right - You might get lucky and guess completely right and this will build an instant rapport with the other person.

Whatever happens it‚Äôs a much more interesting way to get the other person talking and alot more effective than asking endless questions.

By speaking in statements you don‚Äôt overpower the other person with questions. It allows them to continue the conversation if they want to and not feel trapped. Also the other person will ask questions about the statements you make.

It‚Äôs ok to ask questions sometimes just not all the time.

**Lesson five stop using filler words**

This means saying words and phrases such as ‚Äúlike‚Äù, ‚Äúerm‚Äù, ‚Äúyou know‚Äù and ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù

By taking out filler words you‚Äôll be much more interesting to listen to because you can say more in less time.

It‚Äôs about quality, not quantity.

Here‚Äôs an example from the book. Listen to these two different ways of saying the same thing, one with filler words and one without.

‚ÄúSo, I guess what I'm saying is like that I never really felt at home when I lived out there in you know in California the people all just felt kind of like superficial to me and I am didn't really like it I guess.‚Äù

Now take out the filler words.

‚ÄúI never felt at home in California the people felt superficial to me I didn't really like it.‚Äù

Filler words and phrases make speaking to you boring and slow.

Also when you say ‚ÄúI guess‚Äù or ‚Äúyou know‚Äù it come across as though you don‚Äôt fully stand by what you‚Äôre saying so you have to weaken what you said with a filler phrase after it.

So how do you get better at not saying filler words and phrases.

First of all be aware that you‚Äôre doing it, try to consciously make an effort to not say filler words.

Another thing you can do is record yourself trying to explain something and see what filler words you say the most. Keep re-recording yourself until you can explain the whole thing without filler words.

And finally, be ok with silence, if you are more relaxed in silence then you won‚Äôt feel the pressure to always be saying something. This means you are much less likely to say filler phrases. Silences give your brain time to process the conversations and to think of much more interesting responses to what people say.

A pause before replying is recommended by a lot of people because it shows you care enough that you actually want to give a good response and not just say the first thing that comes to mind.

**So, to summarise:**

1. Don't be needy
2. Show your vulnerable side
3. Have an attractive lifestyle
4. Make assumptions rather than asking questions.
5. Stop using filler words

"MOBILE FORMATTING WARNING 


Hey guys, 

I'm 18 years old, and so I've been poking around, trying to find a good fit for a job while I'm in college. 

I decided I would go the trade route, because if all else fails, at least I have that skill. So I began painting, and if I'm being honest, it really isnt that great. The pay is pretty bad, and the work isnt very exciting to me. 

So I got to talking with another buddy of mine who decided to do construction this summer. He got his cert to work an excavator, and he told me he is making $45 AN HOUR. THAT IS GROWN ASS MAN MONEY. Plus, it sounds exciting to me. 

So I began looking at places where I can learn to work heavy machinery, and I've found some local ""colleges"" that offer 3 week courses that get you your certs for all the most basic types of heavy machinery. 

Is this the way to go, or is there a better way? Any advice to me from other people working in trades/construction/heavy machinery? 

I'm in Oregon, living near portland if that helps.

"I'm really interested in research. I'm a college final year student, and I'm ambitious of getting into the core of machine learning, regardless of the effort it takes. I have a habit of occasionally trying to drive theorems I come across on my own, both in mathematics and computer science (especially graph theory, which was full of interesting theorems and derivations and which were relatively easy- except for a few. Trying to discover alternative derivations in mathematics was actually hard and sometimes impossible). 

But the moment I started looking at machine learning, I realized that it was all about experimentation, and not *symbolic reasoning* with thought experiments. Why is that? I'm personally not used to trial error (regardless, I want to learn) and rigorous experimentation. Where should I start? 

As a beginner, I feel that there can be *infinite possible machine learning algorithms*, and we can get any of them working with enough experimentation and tweaking. So can you please tell me what am I missing out, and how should I begin learning?  And is it really true that it is not possible to test out the validity of a machine learning algorithm without conducting experiments, at least on simulated data-sets?

"Negativity sucks, and people who are constantly bemoaning the relentless unfairness of tribulations like _having a job_, _being tired_, and _not always getting exactly what they want_, drive me insane. I like to believe I'm a pretty empathetic person, but my sympathy fades when people throw tantrums about trivial things or when I begin to notice a broader pattern of having a disproportionately bad attitude.

I recognize, however, that this is unfair. Negative people aren't that way by choice. In many cases, these are the result of psychological issues like depression or anxiety. What tricks can I stuff up my sleeves to be more patient and empathetic with people like this?

Edit: For additional context, my principal struggle with this is my wife. We started dating around three years ago and got married early last summer. Since I've known her, she's had anxiety which has slowly gotten worse and worse. When we started dating, it meant that she was sometimes somber and reclusive, but at other times a bouncing-off-the-walls happy kind of girl. Lately, however, her anxiety is more frequent and has started to manifest itself more as anger and negativity, often directed towards me. Even when it's not directed at me at all, it's difficult for me sometimes to be understanding and supportive when sometimes the things that she's complaining about are pretty childish to make a fuss about. Again, I _understand_ that these are symptoms of a totally horrible psychological condition she's fighting through, and that it's unfair of me to see it that way. But it's hard. That's why I'm here asking you wise people for advice.",IWTL to be more sympathetic toward chronically negative people,IWantToLearn

" Hi Everyone,

I have given myself the next 5 years to learn some soft skills. Before I dive a little deeper, here‚Äôs something about myself:

* I‚Äôm very impatient, disorganized and get easily distracted. I don‚Äôt have diagnosed ADHD, but I do see some symptoms. I don‚Äôt plan to see a therapist about it just yet, I feel like I can be a functioning person given I know how manage properly.
* I have problems with finishing something. I start a lot of things with a lot of enthusiasm, but I lose interest and I don‚Äôt follow through. I recently made some improvements in that regard, where I just push through. But I still believe there are some guidance and improvements I can make that can make it more consistent.
* I‚Äôm honestly happy with the kind of person I am. I believe being a little spontaneous, thinking less and showing a lot of initial passion adds a lot to my personality. I don‚Äôt want to change them per say, but would love some improvements around it. For example, I‚Äôm spontaneous - but I‚Äôd like to make that spontaneous activity a little more thought out (am I financially ready to do that? etc.). I have quirky replies, but what if I made fewer quirky jokes, but free up my mind to think a little more critically? 

From these needs and an ongoing effort to better myself, I would like to learn the following skills over the next 5-6 years. It may take longer, and I understand, in practice, they are supposed to last forever. However, the next 5-6 years I want to devote to make sure I actively work on these to make them a habit. 

* **Organized:** I don‚Äôt want to become a hyperactive color coding organizing guru. What I do want to become is have a more thoughtful path to doing a certain task. For start, I‚Äôd like to get into the practice of writing (or breaking) something down before I start the task. I just dive right into things, which makes things really messy down the line. I tried starting a few things much slower - planning it out, writing them down etc. But I often fall of the wagon in a few days. I would like to know about any efficient techniques that is interesting to practice all the time and can become ingrained in my habit. 
* **Patience &amp; Discipline:** I get carried away really fast. I have absolutely no control or patience. I would love to have a structured framework to go off of developing these virtues.
* **Critical Thinking &amp; better problem solving:** I would love to understand and learn how to be better at critical thinking. If there are books and ongoing problem solving exercises I can do on a regular basis, I believe I can be a better person than I am today.

Any ideas, thoughts and suggestions around them will be much appreciated.

All my life I've been interested in the natural sciences, Things like Plants,Animals,Fossils,Minerals, all of it I cant get enough.

"EDIT: This Backstory is quite long, but I implore you to please read it

Hi everybody,

Here‚Äôs the backstory:


I am 22 years old, who graduated last August w/ a Bachelors in Political Science. I am the oldest in my family of 4 siblings, the 1st born in the US, and the 1st to graduate college. I‚Äôve always excelled academically. With all that, I‚Äôve always had a great amount of pressure to succeed and do well, setting an example for my brothers &amp; sister, helping out our parents.


Thankfully, I have no debt, own a vehicle. I live in a rural area in AZ with not much opportunity in this field. My goal is to work in International Affairs whether as a policy dude, diplomat, or working with a NGO (ex: Doctors w/out Borders). The way different countries interact with one another and why, and how that affects us, fascinates me. I feel a strong sense of wanting to help others and believe this route would be the way to go to achieve that, along with using my degree.I am also a Certified Medical Assistant with experience in a Pediatrician‚Äôs Office and Podiatry. More on that later.


Since graduation last August, I was jobless for 4 months until late November. Not even McDonald‚Äôs would hire me. At that point i decided to say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and began volunteering for the local political club.


After a month of volunteering, I get offered the job of Campaign Manager for a local State Senate Candidate. I managed to help the campaign develop and get on good footing. I amicably and mutually parted ways with the Campaign in April after finding out I was lied to and there was no job/career plan for me after November.


For a brief week, I was Canvasser for a Get Out the Vote group, but ultimately decided that wasn‚Äôt for me. Walking around all day in Summer AZ is not something I recommend, unless you need to do it. Props to those that do.


For the remainder of April and May I was with no prospects for my International Affairs goal, so I decided to focus on finding employment again with my Medical Assisting background. Luckily this time, I succeeded. One of the local Reservations was opening up a new hospital and along with that was a massive influx of demand for M.A.‚Äôs. Interview was 1st week of June, 1st work day on July 2nd.


I‚Äôve been here for a month now. I love it and enjoy it here, along with the staff. Always learning. I can envision myself here for the long-run, but I don‚Äôt see myself being here careerwise down the road. The M.A position is not one with a promotion path or economic growth. I currently get paid $14.25/hour, about $29,000 a year, Down to $22,000/a year or about $11.00 per hour after taxes.


I don‚Äôt want to be 23, 25, 27, 30 with no clear career development or path of growth. The uncertainty of the long-term.


Over the past 2 weeks, I heavily contemplated joining the Air Force. I got my medical records done, met with a recruiter, and discussed Officership, and Intel. I ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt for a long list of reasons, more so professionally. I didn‚Äôt want to be stuck with 4 years of a job position I had no desire in doing or control over, but have to stick with due to the commitment of enlisting. I could choose my preferences, but that wasn‚Äôt a guarantee I‚Äôd land them. But more so, I didn‚Äôt want to Be done with my time in the services and feel the same way I did after with college and ask ‚ÄúOK, now what.‚Äù with no long term prospect or path.


I‚Äôve also thought about simply saving enough money to fund a 2-Year Masters Degree study of International Security Studies. I‚Äôve been accepted to this program since August of last year, but have had no way of paying for it. Again, aside from finances, the only thing that‚Äôs holding me back from this is job prospects after graduation. I don‚Äôt want another repeat and would rather not make that investment if there is no certain return.


So now, while employed with my back up Medical certification, I am back at square 1 as to what to do for my long-term and the career I want to pursue.


So regardless of your profession, your location, I ask for your advice, guidance, and help. I don‚Äôt know what to do, and that horrifies me more than any nightmare.



TL;DR I currently stand at square 1 as it comes to finding a path to the career I want. I‚Äôve tried online websites, volunteering (and then working) in a similar field, researching the Air Force, and thought about focusing on getting my master‚Äôs and learn more. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do.",IWTL About International Affairs &amp; Life,IWantToLearn

So how do I learn to explain something to someone.

P.S. To be completely honest with you I spent no joke about 30 min writing this because It was hard for me to find the words that would explain my situation exactly how I understand it.

Right now, I read the Supernatural novelizations. I read novels based on television series as it's easiest for me to picture what's happening since I have a prior reference to call upon (the show and the actors portraying them). I want to read other books that interest me, but then some of them I don't have a reference to picture events or to imagine what's happening as I read the words. Because I cannot easily picture and imagine what these descriptions are that I'm reading, I don't get into the book very much and leave some unfinished (recent example being American Gods).

I'm a baby steps kind of learner, taking what I can learn from the tv novelizations and then I want to go on to other fiction sources that may not have a adaptation for me to help imagine things, and then eventually I want to read nonfiction or self help books.

He's not doing anything management can fire him over or that I can offer proof for- we just really don't like each other- and I'm the only one he acts this way around. Management doesn't have a good track record of responding to complaints, anyways, and I want to leave on a good note given that this is a temporary job. It started when I politely tried to correct him on a few mistakes, given that he's new and was a trainee at the time. He started getting really defensive and ornery, trying to correct *me* on mistakes I knew he was making because I've made the same mistakes, instead of trying to learn. Later on, he started to avoid a customer while wiping down counters as I was busy and couldn't help them, despite making eye contact with them and being right by the register. He ignored multiple polite requests to help the customer, so I had to yell at him to get his attention. He must have taken it personally, because ever since then, he completely ignores my presence when I try to talk to him or pretends not to hear me, with a contemptuous look on his face, and will not talk to me at all despite talking to everyone else. He also has made snide remarks under his breath, and though it's not relevant to his job performance, he's shared some very odd political beliefs that make me uncomfortable. I'm starting to get so angry that I'm lashing out at him and being rude in return. I need to learn how to calm myself down before I end up screaming at him or storming out of the restaurant.

My brother and I are starting college at the end of the month (science related fields).

What I've come up with for now is to exhaust a basic app like Lingo Deer, then hop into a text book or two like New Practical Chinese Reader, Integrated Chinese and then following a more extensive structured path like HSK text books. Does this sound reasonable?

2) Grammar I'm assuming is something one should really go hard at during the initial stages and progressively eases off from as one gets better. Is a separate grammar text book recommended or would it be enough with the grammar included in text books?

3) How should one go about structuring flash cards in anki? Would the variables be Hanzi (w/stroke order), Pinyin, Pronounciation audio, English translation? Allowing any of those variables to act as the main recall trigger?

"I‚Äôm in my 30s. And I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of bitterness about my mother. 

My biggest issue with my mother is that I feel she is incredibly selfish. I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs a full-blown narcissist (actual NPD). Today, whether or not she actually is one is not really my concern. It just simply is about her lack of consideration of others. 

I just find her to be very selfish. She‚Äôs an only child. And just as she‚Äôs surrounded by so much praise and admiration, she‚Äôs also a very poor listener and lacks the ability to take others‚Äô perspectives into consideration. I recently learned that, while in college, my mother earned the nickname ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù from her roommates and friends. 

She‚Äôs constantly forgetting my sister and my birthdays. She laughs about it, attributing it to being a ‚Äúgoofy‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much of an artist to do math‚Äù. She forgets my age and has even told a couple of friends I‚Äôm almost 50 (I‚Äôm 35). The conversation then shifts to her being goofy and funny. 

Just as she can be ‚Äúgoofy‚Äù and the life of the party, she‚Äôs also incredibly distant. Just as she can be full of tears about children of ‚Äúher culture‚Äù (I‚Äôm mixed, with a different perspective and experience from hers, didn‚Äôt grow up with hers. That‚Äôs fine, but today she‚Äôs embraced her background and completely distanced herself from our father‚Äôs/our other half). And just as she can cry over some stupid Facebook animal video (I love animals, but sometimes I need to be listened to too), she has no solid warmth  or empathy for her own children. 

Growing up, I always remember her being well-liked, with plenty of admirers in her community. She‚Äôs an artist and a retired educator (high school and community college). Post-divorce, she went from being a quiet trophy wife (who happened to paint) to becoming a well-known (mostly in her community) artist/poet and educator. 

Before my parents split up, there was a lot of fighting. I had a lot of fear and anxiety, especially as a child. Still, some teachers recognized my own (and my siblings‚Äô) qualities and reached out to our parents. I had a piano teacher who urged my mother to save money for music school. Still, the unspoken message from my mother was generally ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a show-off‚Äù. 


For many years, I‚Äôve struggled with depression, anxiety and social anxiety. I do my best to set goals and take initiative with life. Still, it‚Äôs taken a while for me to move forward with my own career and I‚Äôm far from where I want to be. 

I want to learn how to NOT feel bitter or ripped off with having the mother I have. I love my mother. I do want her to be well. But I‚Äôm realizing she‚Äôs never really going to change at this point. She‚Äôs going to become more and more forgetful and self-involved, demanding, and attention seeking. She‚Äôs never going to grow the empathy for her children that I always wanted. 

It‚Äôs easy to say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt depend on your mom for encouragement, etc.‚Äù but it honestly hurts so bad. 

When I‚Äôve tried to reach out to my mother about anything that bothers me, she would literally listen to the first few words, then she‚Äôd grow bored or just mentally check out. When I was younger, it was usually ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù or ‚Äústop focusing on yourself so much‚Äù.

I exercise regularly, and eat as healthy as I can. I don't drink or do drugs. I try to be a positive person generally, have made often a habit of regularly taking a moment to consciously appreciate the good things in my life. I've already looked into stoicism, some parts of which didn't  really click with me, and a couple of self-help books that focus on CBT techniques, with limited success. Meditation has proved more effective, but it's not enough.

"Hi,

My background: 

I‚Äôm from Belgium, I am 26 years old and almost finished with a PhD in Computer Science and a Masters in Civil Engineering, Computer Science and thinking of going freelance.  
Due to a financial windfall, I am in a strong financial/personal situation: I have no rent to pay, few expenses and a good amount of savings (1M+).

In the PhD, I had flexibility, freedom and independence and have several published papers at international conferences.  
The skills I have developed are mainly in light of PhD opportunities and research, which is IoT security, embedded devices, paper writing, presenting, giving courses and general problem solving skills.   
Programming skills are medium-level experience in Java, Python and C.  
General Computer skills are medium-level with Windows, Linux, Eclipse, Latex, Word, Excel, ‚Ä¶ 

I do not consider myself an expert in any of these but definitely capable.

As such, after the PhD, I would like to maintain flexibility and freedom and was thinking of going Freelance so that I can both (1) earn money and (2) enjoy flexibility to pick my own hours.

I love to travel a lot, which is why I like flexibility. Also, considering the financial situation, I do not think it is necessary to work full-time but this is something I‚Äôd like to evaluate as I continue on this path.

This is very general but I am looking for any and all advice for somebody with my profile and my desires, in Belgium.

So what would you advise to somebody like me? Feel free to take your answer in any direction.

More specific questions:

1. What are essential skills to learn/develop for my intended path?
   1. Other programming languages?
   2. Stuff like VIM?
   3. Other types of skills?
   4. Generally, what skills should enable my goals the best? E.g., being an experienced Javascript guy?
2. How important is additional certification beyond my masters and PhD?
3. How should I approach getting work in flexible environments? Websites? Contact specialised firms?
4. What else would you advise for work/finances for somebody in my case?
5. Any advice you would give for somebody in my case on a more personal development type level? General life advice is welcome!

It‚Äôs really rewarding and a great way to unwind after a busy day, but I‚Äôm feeling limited by my technique. I don‚Äôt expect to ever play at a high level, but I would like to practice efficiently and put in work where it is most needed!

"I'm from Poland, I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering, I was doing really well in uni top 3 in my year. Problems began with my thesis, as I was neglecting it so much even I really want to do it. Finding scientific articles don't really help, found a few related in English and some German not in my mother tongue, I have got no support from my prof, I should change but I didn't. In my studies I did quite a good job, always helping others, projects hands in before due time, never failed an exam, labs or whatever. I had a really good work ethic. I end up defending my thesis 1 year after I end up college, got a grade that lower my final diploma mark. Now I can't prove that I actually was good at studying, best in math classes. I'm working right now in data entry job that pays badly for 1,5 year, not my major related band still living with parents and I can do some savings and started learning about personal finances.

* \-I have a 1,5-year gap in my studies, my friends are ending their masters right now
* \-I regret that I didn't leave my hometown to study in better college, or that i didn't change my major just because I had good marks to some more IT related major.
* \-I was really depressed in college when last year ended I didn't leave my house, didn't wanted to live. It actually started just before college when I had to choose major which I wanted to study and escalated in my last year ending with screwing up me mentally
* \-and have no social life, living 1,5 hour far from campus. I could end up even with higher marks but want to lose all day just to show up for 1 hour in class and 3 or more on buses.
* \-procrastination really highs up, started watching Netflix, reading quora and reddit, neglecting my physical health.

I actually feel worse than people who never studied just come for a diploma, I was always a perfectionist, good grades in every school always top, best in math and know I feel like I failed some shitty college or that I work hard and screw up at the end. I don't know if I'm supposed to study for my master in this uni even if it was ""lousy one"" and what major or I should leave to my 1 year older sister who lives in another city alone to study there in better uni but don't if I could after 1,5 gap in studies more to 2 if I wanted to enroll in master related to my major or exactly the same and I would be really stressed out as they could be more knowledgeable, better or I didn't remember what I have learned after that gap end depression

My skill, what I learn are:

* \-AutoCAD, Inventor and did some projects in Catia, SolidWorks, and some Ansys
* \-Good skills in MS Excel, VBA
* \-some skill in SciLab\[Matlab\]
* \-as for CAM we were learning some program but classes wasnt good and not much pratice
* \-I am learning python, and I did some projects using Arduino and Raspberry

I always wanted to be successful but now I feel that I run out of time, seeing my friends making their career ending their masters and earning quite a decent money.

I thought about IT related majors as u should be good with electronics and programming before enrolment, but that not the case as my friend showed working in the biggest tech company in the city. I want to have a purpose to be passionate and successful in my job, always improving learning something new. Like my sister with her CS, but she started really early (when she was 11 y.o \] and she had a job during all college years and hs.

\-*and I graduated 1 year later which look bad in my CV, don't know what to do, I look like failure and don't want to live anymore, even I screw up just my 2 last year but was a significant one, thinking about what other people think like I was some stupid student who needs one more year to pass in shitty college, and I know a guy who was really bad, failed every exam, cheats to pass, had to repeat a lot of classes, end up in time with the same mark.*

Programming was something that I was always considering as it needs analytical thinking, and I wanted to do some projects, learn about AI, machine learning, and always was afraid about how competitive market is as programming is learned very widely and I didn't have IT-related major.

Or that some simple programming jobs will be replaced by AI, and only the best one stay with math and CS majors, passionate from childhood. But never really started learning it as I was studying major not much related and didn't have time. I loved math especially probabilistic and with a math major or CS, I think I could do some really interesting projects. On the other hand, Mechanical give tool as FES, or aerodynamic but that seems i should relearn and learn a lot.

I‚Äôve been trying to read news (mostly on the iPhone News app) more and stay informed over the past months and the wealth of information is both overwhelming and under-informative. There is a congressional candidate who is openly pro-rape and pro-pedophilia and today is the first I‚Äôve ever read the word ‚Äúincel‚Äù despite it apparently being a buzzword and the new hot subculture in media for months. Also there‚Äôs possibly liquid water on Mars and great fantasy books being published and other very positive unrelated things I‚Äôm sure but...neo-nazis are still a thing. 

What are the important issues? How many current events should you read/watch/learn about a day and how do you respond to it constructively? Do you just try to be a good person and better society through existing? What are you supposed to do if you vote but don‚Äôt have the passion or knowledge to get more involved in politics or protests? How do you keep articulate without it consuming what you enjoy? Personally I can afford to keep my head in the sand and only stick it out occasionally, and that makes me feel bad and terrifies me. 

Friends, family, video essayists talking about current films, all seem like they are always on-top of things but...how? Is there some social media channel or platform? I‚Äôve seen several posts recommending the Economist. 

Am I just confusing having an opinion and being able to articulate it, while being averagely informed, with being well-informed and able to give a succinct and enlightened argument for you position at the drop of a hat? The latter is my ideal and it seems like people can reach it but I also know that‚Äôs hours of research and careful reading and notes and a daily if not hourly endeavor, and more often a field of study. Especially if you want to try and remain relatively objective in your knowledge and articulate in your opinions.

I‚Äôm having a hard time reconciling my want to be deeply informed and enlightened on the current world we live in, to know and respond to what‚Äôs going on, and a desire to enjoy my own life, which involves reading fiction and comics and trying to get better at drawing and improving my performance at my job, which seems almost selfish and the equivalent to burying my head in the sand at the moment.

"First of all, I am a rookie to reddit and also the topic mentioned above, so please excuse any offenses or mistakes. I don't even know if this post is in the right section. But I am here to learn and improve.

*More specific questions at the bottom
The title says it all, but for those of you who would like more info, before replying, or are just interested, here you go:


I am currently 17, about to start my last year of high school. I am fortunate to be talented in maths and most other logic based subjects. At university I am planning to study some maths-meets-computer science course (they are called different at every uni I checked until now).
My personal interest and enjoyment in these two subjects, made me work ahead of the day to day school syllabus. This, having the effect, that the final school year will be rather easy for me, with little new content. 
After finishing high school, I want to take a 1 year break. As I have rather little practical skills, I figured, that coding would be my best chance to finance this. 
Now, to get to the point, I have one year to learn the skills that are required. The studying itself is not a problem, I am a good individual learner. Until now I have found plenty of resources, for every topic I have studied, though I would be grateful for every recommendation.


The thing, that I am having trouble with, is the general direction, in which to head. What would be more likely to pay off, programming or web developement? Which language would be the best to learn, in either case (I have a good start in c#)? Where would be my best chances to find jobs/employment, when it comes to it? What are the skills, that I can learn, which give me the best chance for all of this?


I am sorry, that it all ended up being so long. I would like to thank you all, in advance, for reading, replying, recommendations, which some of you, with more experience and knowledge on the topic, hopefully have for me. I would appreciate any good advice or even just corrections on the terminology, which I have most likely misused.

I really like school. I like going to lectures or classes. I like listening to an educated person offer me information, sharing ideas and experiences with my classmates, and practicing what I've learned. I like following a plan created by someone with more expertise that dictates the order, the skills, and the content associated with learning a given subject. That plan gives me direction and makes it easier to learn things. I put in a lot of effort on any research paper or presentation to which I am assigned, but I find it really difficult to learn things on my own without a teacher. I tried to learn Spanish on my own. I tried to learn how to play the piano on my own. But those things fell trough. It's hard to know where to start, what to correct, what I should be learning, what information is important, how to do things correctly. 

I'm also doing a political internship with students who are so motivated and are great self learners. I find that they're just really interested in things. They always want to know more and don't stop at any length when trying to figure things out. They watch the news, talk about it with others, read lots of books, listen to podcasts, do political extra curricular a and internships. I don't do that. I personally really like writing research papers and doing assignments. I feel like if I were to just listen to podcasts and read books all the time, I'd just be resting on my knowledge and would not know how to apply it, so it makes putting in that effort seem kind of useless. 

I even know kids I go to school with who build their own computers. I know about kids that did or are doing extraordinary things just by pushing themselves and being really interested and action-oriented.  

I remember reading the book Spare Parts about 4 undocumented high school students who built an underwater robot that beat MIT in a robotics competition. None of them had any real prior experience with robotics, they were economically disadvantaged, and they went to a poor-performing  school. Still, they managed to learn and ended up building a really creative yet functional robot. I've never had the chance, but I don't know if I could do that. 


Part of the reason is lack of discipline. I watch podcasts and read books that I'm not really interested in and eventually default to scrolling through social media. Maybe I'm just doing those things because I feel like I have to, but how do I stay interested in things that don't interest me? How do I find the things that do interest me? Part of the reason is also not knowing where to start, where to find resources, how to get involved, what I should be focusing on. I really like the idea of taking on a personal project and I really like the idea of learning more about my field.

Essentially, I am a binger. If its not binge eating, its binge spending, and sometimes its even binge gaming or browsing the internet. I feel as though most of my problems in my life that I‚Äôm currently trying to tackle are all deeply rooted in the fact that my willpower is weak. I know that there are mantras and things you can do in decision making times, but I usually find that the rational part of my brain subconsciously black outs or is silenced by my desire for whatever is tempting me, be it the second plate of chinese food I had yesterday that I ate until I could no longer eat more of, or the $300 shoes I just ordered yesterday night that I didn‚Äôt need, (including the pants I ordered immediately after because imo they would look sick asf with the shoes), or even my staying up on my phone scrolling through bullshit until 4am that caused me to be impaired at work the next day and almost took me home early.

I believe that if I could just learn willpower as a core life skill that I need to employ the help of to dictate my decisions, I could steer myself away from so many bad decisions and ultimately pick my life up. The binging is what really gets me with all of these things. I think what I really need to learn is how I can feel satisfied with my decision making, enough so to understand that when my urge to binge comes over me I don‚Äôt blindly follow it and abandon what I know is right, but instead I can call on my willpower that I will have developed, and employ it. I know this post is sort of a mess because not even I really know what I need in specific.

Every single day I wake up early to go work for a very, very small wage. It's barely enough to keep me going. 

I am educated and have a degree in computer science. Even if I get a good job in my field, I will have to work for the rest of my life, while making wealthy people even wealthier with my work. 

I want to learn how to become wealthy from nothing. I am tired of being looked down on for being poor, i'm tired of having to be frugal, and i'm tired of worrying about the future and wellbeing of my wife and children.

I'm lucky that Canada has a great healthcare system, because if I were back home or in the US, I would have been greatly screwed. 

I am a very hard worker, but i've seen too many people work hard their entire lives, break their backs working, and then retire with barely enough to keep food on their tables every day.

Meanwhile i'm seeing kids on youtube who have no talent other than being obnoxious make more money in 1 year than most people make in 50. 

I'm not here to bash on anyone, i'm just saying I am ready to move from working myself to death, to working outside the box, so that I may have a chance of escaping my financial classification. 

When I first came to Canada, I had nothing. I had to live on the streets while I went to school and worked 2 part time jobs. I finally got my apartment soon afterwards, but while on the streets and in shelters, I met so many broken souls who had degrees or trades that got their lives completely ended because of a disability, criminal record, accident, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's compounded by some Catholic guilt, but she is obsessed with her own mistakes and her ""screw ups"", which leads to her being very irritable and snappy with me and the kids. The most mundane things will make her angry, and she will walk around as if her life is an unbearable burden. She also has had severe episodes of health anxiety regarding nonsensical possibilities (e.g. getting stabbed by a plant in a flower shop and being terrified she will get AIDS), which may also be related to her sense of guilt, in that she thinks she deserves to be punished for some reason. She is fixated on cancer, particularly. She also freaks out about health concerns for our kids.

&amp;#x200B;

She is a very emotional person, while I am very stoic and logical. I try to get her to label her emotions and re-engage her cognitive thinking, but it doesn't work. When her anxiety flares, she loses all critical thinking ability, patience, and control over her emotions. When it's not fully flared, she still will ask bizarre questions that make me feel like she isn't even trying to think, rather she wants someone else to give her the answer. Most worrying to me is that she completely freaks out at the slightest hint of a crisis, and 

&amp;#x200B;

She has been on medication before, but really just for her severe episodes, and that only served as a band-aid. She has also used counselors before, but that doesn't seem to help, despite her talking about her concerns relentlessly with me and her family. I try to encourage her to build skills and spend time on herself to build her self-confidence, but she doesn't seem to have the motivation, or she will offer excuses like she doesn't have the time, despite me saying I will give her the time to do something, anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for me to understand how to get through to her, but the mounting pointless medical bills and my fear of the kids being affected is really pressing me to try new approaches. Again, to be clear, she is not like this all the time, and can really be an entertaining, fun-loving person, and a fantastic mom. That only makes me more determined to help her manage her condition.

"I have always wanted to own my own businesses, but I have no idea how to go about it.

At the present time, I am drowning in debt, and I intend to pay it off before I even attempt a business.  This gives me about two years to learn and plan.

Here are a few questions I have:

- Do I need to love *all* coffee to own a coffee shop?  For example, I really am not a huge fan of black coffee.  I know I can learn to like it (I am actually forcing myself through a cup-a-day).  Is this necessary?

- I have no background in coffee at all.  I just like fancy drinks that taste delicious - and coffee-beverages are my favorite.  What steps do I need to take to become an expert in coffee?

- Should I try to fund the business completely myself?  Or should I find backers?  I'm worried that if I find a bunch of backers and then the business fails, I'll be in the hole a lot of money - however if I fund it myself, I'll be in the hole a lot of money either way (at least until the business pays itself off).

- Finally, I simply don't know where to start.  Any tips?

"Hello friends, today has been a very bad day for me and I would like to know how can I stop feeling like crap after I get returned a low grade (exam, quizzes, etc...)  

I studied chemistry 7 hours straight for the chemistry quiz, today I got it back and I got a 68% out of 100%. I effort myself a lot to try and do great on assignments or tests like these. This is my worst chemistry grade right now and I feel like it‚Äôs the end of the world and that how could such effort be rewarded like this (I‚Äôm studying medicine). 

The students of my chemistry class that are geniuses got 80s%and the average got 70s%

I got this chemistry exam back 1 hour before my biology exam. Which got me very depressed for the time I actually took the biology exam. I now feel I did TERRIBLE on that biology exam.

Fellow friend, how can I stop thinking a 68% will ruin my life and actually better myself. How can I stop thinking in the bad and think in the good. How could have I stopped thinking about that 68% while I took a totally different exam? What great methods of studying discipline can I implement on my day to day basis?

"So Spanish is technically my first language, but I moved to the USA when I was very young. As a result of that, i am much more comfortable speaking English than Spanish. 

I definitely would consider myself a fluent speaker, but sometimes when I have conversations in Spanish I am not very confident with more advanced sentences. 

For example, today on the phone with somebody I wanted to say ‚ÄúThat is an excellent idea and I am planning on doing that as soon as possible‚Äù, and I had some trouble forming that. I said ‚ÄúEso es una buen idea y lo voy hacer ahorita‚Äù, which just translates to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good idea and I‚Äôm gonna do it now‚Äù. The general idea is there, but it‚Äôs not exactly what I wanted to say. I was able to communicate effectively, but my grammar and phrasing was more than likely incorrect. 

How do I go about improving this? I want to improve specifically professional conversational Spanish. I‚Äôve downloaded Spanish learning apps, but those teach me nothing since they‚Äôre way too simple and rudimentary so they just waste my time. 

Thanks in advance! ",IWTL how to improve Spanish speaking skills as a ‚Äúnative‚Äù speaker.,IWantToLearn
