### Description

This project examines two different subreddits and the language intricacies of classifying each post. The notebook "Project 3 Webscraping" is designed to utilize Reddit's API to scrape 1,000 posts from [`r/geocaching`](https://www.reddit.com/r/geocaching) and [`r/IWantToLearn`](https://www.reddit.com/r/iwanttolearn). 

The notebook "Project 3 Modeling" performs the exploratory data analysis, natural language processing using CountVectorizer and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, and a classifying model pipeline consisting of one ensemble method, one non-parametric estimator, and logistic regression.
